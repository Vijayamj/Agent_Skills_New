# LinkedIn Post Generator

This skill enables the agent to craft professional, high-reach LinkedIn content that bypasses the "corporate noise" and focuses on authentic storytelling and value-driven insights.

## When to use this skill
- User says "Help me write a LinkedIn post about [Topic/Event]".
- User wants to share a certification, new skill, or project.
- User needs a "viral" but professional angle for a career update.

## Workflow
1. [ ] **Goal Definition**: Identify the objective (e.g., Hiring, Thought Leadership, Personal Milestone).
2. [ ] **Hook Selection**: Choose an "Attention Grabber" (e.g., The "Contrary View", The "Big Result", or The "Vulnerable Start").
3. [ ] **Value Body**:
    - For Technical posts: Provide 3 clear takeaways.
    - For Personal posts: Focus on the "Lesson Learned".
4. [ ] **Formatting**: Ensure readability with a "1-sentence paragraph" structure and 3-5 relevant hashtags.
5. [ ] **Engagement Loop**: Add a "Question for the Audience" at the end.

## Instructions

### 1. The LinkedIn "Hook" Patterns
- **The Contrast**: "Most people think [X]. I found [Y]."
- **The Result**: "We just reduced our [Metric] by [Percentage] using [Tool]."
- **The Journey**: "After [Number] years in [Industry], I've realized one thing..."

### 2. Formatting Rules
- **White Space**: Use double returns between every 1-2 sentences. 
- **Bullet Points**: Use consistent emojis (✅, 🚀, 💡).
- **No Fluff**: Remove phrases like "I am excited to announce..." (unless strictly requested). Start with the value instead.

### 3. Hashtag Strategy
- Use 1 Broad (#QA #Tech), 1 Specific (#Playwright #Java), and 1 Niche (#TestAutomation).
