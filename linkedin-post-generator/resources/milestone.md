[HOOK - e.g., 8.7 years of UAT. 1.7 years of Automation. And a productive maternity break.]

After taking time off to care for my newborn, I’m officially back in the game and more industry-ready than ever. 🚀

Many people view career breaks as "gaps." I view them as periods of focused growth.

During my sabbatical, I:
✅ Completed an Automation Testing Certification (StarAgile).
✅ Finished an internship at High Catch Private Limited.
✅ Mastered Selenium, Java, and POM framework architecture.

I’m now looking to leverage my 10+ years of cumulative QA and Operations experience for a new challenge in a QA role.

If you’re looking for a tester who understands the nuances of UAT, the speed of Playwright/Selenium, and the rigor of Agile—let’s connect!
