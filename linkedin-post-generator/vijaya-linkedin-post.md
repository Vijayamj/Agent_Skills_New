🚀 **10+ Years of Experience. A Productive Maternity Break. And a Stronger-Than-Ever Comeback.**

Many people view career breaks as "gaps." I view mine as a period of intentional growth and high-impact upskilling. 

After taking time off to care for my newborn, I didn’t just stay updated—I leaned in. 

Over the past few months, I have:
✅ Completed an **Automation Testing Certification** with StarAgile.
✅ Finished an **Automation Testing Internship** at High Catch Private Limited.
✅ Mastered **Selenium with Java**, API Automation (Postman), and Git/DevOps workflows.
✅ Explored the future of our industry with the **"AI in Software Testing"** course on Udemy.
✅ Stayed connected with the global testing community through **Testflix 2024**.

I’m now ready to leverage my extensive background—from being a Junior Programmer to a District Computer Programmer—combined with my new expertise in Automation and AI-driven testing.

I am looking for a challenging **QA Engineer / Automation Tester** role where I can contribute my 10+ years of cumulative experience to build robust, high-quality software.
