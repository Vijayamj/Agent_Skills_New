# 🐦 Tweet Options: The Future of Testing in 2026

### Option 1: The "Wake Up Call" (Controversial/Bold)
**Hook:** Selenium alone is a career death wish in 2026. 🛑

The testing landscape has evolved. Speed and reliability are non-negotiable. While Selenium built the foundation, **Playwright** is the new standard, and **AI** is the multiplier. 

If you aren’t using AI-driven self-healing scripts or intelligent test generation, you’re testing in the past.

✅ Selenium = The Foundation
✅ Playwright = The Modern Speed
✅ AI = The Scale

Don't just find bugs; prevent them with intelligent automation. Even as a Manual Tester, understanding these tools is your ticket to staying relevant.
